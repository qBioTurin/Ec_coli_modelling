## Performing flux Variability Analysis (FVA) for a given model ##
##################################################################

## Rationale

# 1. Antibiotic lethality may be initiated by altered cellular redox state. 
# The redox stress potentially rewires central metabolism, cellular respiration, 
# and iron resulting in cellular damage

# 2. FVA was used to show perturbed central metabolism and redox balance in
# the presence of antibiotics and reprogrammed metabolism as compensatory 
# mechanisms in resistant populations.

## Methods

# 1. To understand the effect of antibiotics on C. difficile cellular metabolism 
# the changes in feasible metabolic flux distributions in the presence of 
# metronizadole (WT+mtz) was delineated using FVA and analysed.

# 2. The metabolic reprogramming due to antibiotic selection pressures was 
# analysed by FVA using customized models to represent WT, ChlR and StrpR
# Differences in unique forced fluxes/rates between resistant and susceptible
# populations in central metabolic pathways indicate compensatory metabolic
# reprogramming.

# 3. One can thus determine the minimum and maximum flux value that each 
# reaction in the model can take up while satisfying all constraints on 
# the system for a specific objective

## optimizeProb() attribute algorithm = "fv"
## Class "sysBiolAlg_fv"

## Further arguments passed to optimizer. 
## Argument algorithm is set to "fv", further arguments passed to the constructor 
## for objects of class sysBiolAlg_fv, see there for details
